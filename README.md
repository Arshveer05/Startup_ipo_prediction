**Problem Statement**


Despite the critical role startups play in economic growth and job creation, the majority fail before reaching a significant liquidity event, such as an acquisition or an IPO. Traditional startup evaluation methods, which rely heavily on qualitative assessments and historical financial data, often fail to capture the complexity of the modern startup landscape. Advancements in machine learning (ML) and data availability present an opportunity to develop predictive models that assess the likelihood of startup success by analyzing structured data (e.g., funding history, financial metrics) and unstructured data (e.g., sentiment analysis, market trends). However, challenges such as data bias, market uncertainty, and external disruptions hinder the reliability of such models. This research aims to develop a multi-feature ML model that integrates diverse data sources to improve startup success prediction, aiding investors, entrepreneurs, and policymakers in more effective decision-making and capital allocation.
